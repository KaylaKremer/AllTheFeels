# All The Feels: Emoji Transfer Learning with ml5.js & MobileNet ðŸ˜‚

## About
This is a quick machine learning project I put together with `ml5.js`. It demonstrates the concept of `transfer learning` using the already pre-trained model of `MobileNet`. All The Feels teaches your computer how to recognize different human emotions via the webcam by categorizing facial expressions with the emoji buttons the user clicks on to train the model with.

## How To Use
`git clone` or download, then `cd` into the location of the repo.

If you have **Python 3.0** installed on your computer, run `python -m http.server 8081`

If you have **Python 2.7** installed on your computer, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8081`

Finally, open your browser and go to the url `localhost:8081`

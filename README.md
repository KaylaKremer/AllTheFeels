# All The Feels: Emoji Transfer Learning with ml5.js & MobileNet ðŸ˜‚

## About
This is a quick project I put together in a few hours using `ml5.js` for my presentation on machine learning for the web. It demonstrates the concept of `transfer learning` using the already pre-trained model of `MobileNet`. The concept is to train your computer how to recognize different human emotions via the webcam by categorizing facial expressions with the emoji buttons.

## How To Use
`git clone` or download, then `cd` into the location of the repo.

If you have **Python 3.0** installed on your computer, run `python -m http.server 8081`

If you have **Python 2.7** installed on your computer, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8081`

Finally, open your browser and go to the url `localhost:8081`
